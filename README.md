# Casey Universe

You play as Zack Casey andÂ your best friend, Anthony Foxclaw, is a planet designer that discovers magic stones, known as the Essence, discovered in an asteroid belt. You two set off on an adventure across the universe in search for more, and discover their power in this text adventure game. Casey Universe is based on [Twine](https://twinery.org/) and distributed using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).

## Lore Book

Casey Universe is made with the aid of NovelAI's WIP text adventure mode. The Lore Book included in the root, ``Casey Universe.lorebook``, is a JSON file. It's contents normally part of a larger ``.story`` file. 

Right now, this is a also a WIP since it was originally told from Anthony's perspective during the initial playtest. It relies heavily on varies roles, most based on careers from Sims 4, in order to provide a rich experience, most locations are still based on earth, at the moment, and some magic elements were adopted from D&D.
